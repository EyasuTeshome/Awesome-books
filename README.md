# Awesome Books


In this project with my partner we crated a simple website to add and remove books from a list. in addition to that all the books which are added to the list will be saved automaticalluy to the localstorage, thus the file can be seen even if the page is reloaded.

In this project I have used linter for HTML and CSS and Javascript, to make sure there are no linter errors on the code. This Awesome Books website contains Three main functionalities:
1. Add Book
2. Save the added Book in local storage
